Log what you worked on today and look at some stats later

TODO
----
Stats bug w/ empty msg entries?
Allow to use numbers instead of dates for edit & stats e.g. 0 = today and -2 2 days ago
	i guess positive numbers can be allowed too
Explain default no option behaviour of commands
Custom date formats not just dd-mm-yy
